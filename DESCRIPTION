Description: A colour picker that can be used as an input in 'Shiny' apps
    or Rmarkdown documents. The colour picker supports alpha opacity, custom
    colour palettes, and many more options. A Plot Colour Helper tool is
    available as an 'RStudio' Addin, which helps you pick colours to use in your
    plots. A more generic Colour Picker 'RStudio' Addin is also provided to let 
    you select colours to use in your R code.
